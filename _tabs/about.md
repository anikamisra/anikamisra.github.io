Hi! My name is Anika (Aw-nick-uh) and I'm a Master's student at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science and Engineering. I got my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from UCLA this past June. In this blog I plan to write about LLM and AI topics that interest me, with a focus on LLM reasoning and multimodal AI. My goal in creating this blog is to A) motivate myself to read more papers, B) break down complex topics, and C) think of insights and questions that could be used for research. 

In my spare time, I like to draw, go to the gym, and listen to & create electronic music. 

Thanks for stopping by!
